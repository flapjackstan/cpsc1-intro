# Outline and Plan

## Structure 
- Primarily following a structure similar to Harvards CS50, however we can stop and focus on specfic things where need be
    - https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/
- Highly reccomend watching the videos
- Programs we will be using are Scratch, Javascript, Terminal: Bash/PowerShell, Python, and Git

## Dialogue 
### What do you think programming is? 

**Knowing how to use a plunger does not make you a plumber. Same goes for programming. Knowing Python or Javascript does not make you a programmer.**
- Programming isnt: writing code, writing python or javascript.
- Programming is something that we ourselves already do - planing stuff and doing it!
    - PB and J example
- Computer Programmers are people who are very good at detailing solutions on a computer using programming languages
- A Program is a tool you make to solve a problem. Sometimes the problem isnt obvious. 
    - Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom saw the problem (or lack of a product) with social media and not being able to share pictures

Programming languages and software are tools for programmers. Nothing else.

### What is a computer? How does it work?
- Neither do I (exactly). Nor do I know how a car works. Yet I use it. What makes it work for a user? - Abstraction

- Abstraction is hiding away the deep technical stuff and overlaying it with something simple. Turn wheel left, go left.

- Abstraction is one of the key core concepts of computer science. And really what our goal is for programming is to build something complex but simple to use.

### What is computer science?
- Its the history, the concepts, theory, and uses of computation. It is a stupid big topic and itself is a subtopic of mathamatics.

## Programmtic Thinking

### Scratch

https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=getStarted

A beginner and kid frindly introduction to programming basics

### Tasks
Do at 3 of these tutorials and demo them the next time we meet

## Other Resources
Our plan is to follow CS50s outline but below are also super great resources and tips on how I have used them when stuck learning something.

- **Youtube** - Search something like: "For loops in python" or "Recursion CPSC", or "python classes tutorial"
    - In my experience, the longer the video the better it is because they thoroughly dive into it. The best ones have usually been lectures from universites or professors, However there are also really great tutorials out there too.
- **Google** - I usually use this in two ways. 
    - If im debugging (aka trying to fix an error) I will type in the error and add whatever language I am using. 
    - If i know I will be using a specfic tool, Ill google that tool and look at the documentation for it or other blog posts related to using that tool
- **StackOverflow** - Largest programming community where people post a problem or issue and other programmers respond
    - I typically get redirected here from google and is a good resource to fix an issue. However, a lot of the times, peoples answers will go over your head because you don't have enough knowledge to understand solutions or even know what your actual problem is.
- **Medium** - Blog posts where people kind of talk through using different things and use good examples
