# Recap
Abstraction - Adding layers on top of complexity to hide away its mechanics.

Scratch - Not a programming language, but lets you practice programmatic thinking.

JavaScript - First language we've used so far

- variables
- data types: strings and number (though there are actually more)


# Dialogue

**So how do I actually create a program?**

So we've established that programming isnt just writing code and its actually a lot of things. One of the first things you do before you even write any code is you think about the steps you need to take. You can take this a bit further and write something called pseudo-code.

Pseudo-code is using the language we already know and structuring our task into pieces that we can later translate

- Ask for username

- Ask for passwork

- Check if username and password are correct

- Let them access their page

**Okay, but how do I actually make a physical program then?**

All we need is to choose a programming language and have its interpreter/compiler. Depending on the scope of your program, this is all you need. We'll be using python for our first dive into programming.

We will also need a text editor.

# Lets make a program

Since we have some pseudo code already written, lets try to flesh it out into an actual program!

Lets make an app that would let you enter our social media page.

# Looking For Solutions
If you don't know how to do something, google it. Try to use keywords that will get you better results. Try your best to use appropriate key words to search for. I find its best to take a fundamental approach to searches.

Instead of searching "how to get username in python"

Search "python ask for input"

# Debugging

Read error messages and look them up!

Rubber ducky programming - Explain your code line by line to an inatimate object. Usually when you take it slow, look, and think, youll realize youre doing something you didnt intend to do and youll realize the error in your thinking.

# [Murphy's Law](https://www.angelo.edu/faculty/kboudrea/cheap/cheap3_murphy.htm#Murphy's%20Law) - Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong

There are infinitely numerous things that can go wrong with your program. Either in using it, designing it, building it, maintaining it, etc...

Its best engineering practice to keep this in mind and know how to deal with it.

Here are some of the things that you will experience in coding

- Confusion
- Errors/Bugs
- Redesigns
- Refactors
- Frustration
- Overthinking / Over Engineering
- Not knowing something
- Overestimation

When any of these set in try to take a moment and take appropriate action

- Study related/fundamental topics
- Debugging methods (more later)
- Start from scratch
- Documentation and comments
- Take a break
- Step away and get something minimal first
- Read articles, documentation, youtube, google
- Dont assume you know exactly how something works
