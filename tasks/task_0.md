# Task 0

Recreate the guessing number game I made in scratch! See the original [scratch code](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/653999377/editor/) for general code pattern!

You want to create an app that generates a random number between 1 and 10 and continually ask the user to guess the number until they get it right. If they go over, let them know they went over, if they are under let them know they are under. 

Some python functions and programming basics that you will need to accomplish this are:
- `for loops` or `while loops`
- `input()`
- `random.randint()` 
- `if` and `else` statements
- library `import`

Also some things to consider when writing this.
- Pseudo code can help to organize your thoughts
- Google is your friend
- Youtube is also an amazing resource
- Remember, there is no such thing as cheating in programming! If you can find this program somewhere online, you can use it. Just make sure to do your best in understanding why it works!
